@W: MT536 |Found constraint file with both legacy-style and FPGA timing constraints. 
@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: BN132 :"/build/vexriscv_imac+dcache.v":5456:2:5456:7|Removing sequential instance soc.cpu.vexriscv.decode_to_execute_IS_RS2_SIGNED because it is equivalent to instance soc.cpu.vexriscv.decode_to_execute_IS_RS1_SIGNED. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.
@W: Z241 :"/build/top.sdc":1:0:1:0|Source for clock clk12_clk should be moved to net pin_clk12_0.buf.buf.i connected to driving cell pin pin_clk12_0.buf.buf.buf0.O 
@W: MT548 :"/build/top.sdc":2:0:2:0|Source for clock clk not found in netlist.

@W: MT530 :"/build/vexriscv_imac+dcache.v":6966:2:6966:7|Found inferred clock _top_pll_|clk_inferred_clock which controls 8096 sequential elements including soc.cpu.vexriscv.IBusCachedPlugin_cache.ways_0_tags[20:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT530 :"/build/top.v":7098:2:7098:7|Found inferred clock _top_pll_|fast_clk_inferred_clock which controls 122 sequential elements including soc.spi0.cs_cdc.stage1. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MF511 |Found issues with constraints. Please check constraint checker report "/build/impl/top_impl_cck.rpt" .
